# Final-Project--Utility-Solar-Impact-on-Home-Prices
Final Project for ENV 617 - Samantha Almonacid, Alberto Andrade, Esaac Mazengia, Elana Shi

As the United States moves towards decarbonizing the energy system, utility scale solar will become more widespread due to its affordability and production of minimal-to-zero emissions. [The Solar Energy Industries Association](https://www.seia.org/) finds that there are more than 37,000 megawatts of utility-scale solar projects in operation, with another 112,000 megawatts being developed.

Given the growing prominence of utility scale solar, our group wanted to better understand the geographic context of the communities that they are sited near and explore utility scale solar's impacts on the housing market. We seek to answer the following question:

**Does the existence of nearby (1 mile) utility scale solar impact property values at the neighborhood level?**

To answer this question, we will use the following data:

**United States Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (USPVDB)**
This database contains information on the locations and boundaries of U.S. PV facilities with a capacity of 1 megawatt or greater.

**Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)**
This data presents the typical values for homes within the 65th to 95th percentile range for a given region. The data is smoothed and seasonally adjusted, and does not account for inflation.

**Neighborhood Boundaries**
This data contains boundaries for 17,000 Zillow neighborhoods in the United States.

**United States Boundaries**
This data contains boundaries for all states in the United States.
